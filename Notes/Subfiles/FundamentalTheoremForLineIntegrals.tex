Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b{F'(x) dx} = F(b) - F(a)
\end{equation*}
where $F'(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. Considering $\nabla f$ of a function $f$ of two or three variables as a sort of derivative of $f$, then FTC can be extending to line integrals.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Theorem: FTC Line Integral
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{theorem}
Let $C$ be a smooth curve given by the vector function $\textbf{r}(t), a\le t \le b$. Let $f$ be a differentiable function of two or three variables whose gradient vector $\nabla f$ is continuous on $C$. Then
\begin{equation*}
\int_C{\nabla f \cdot d\textbf{r}}=f(\textbf{r}(b)) - f(\textbf{r}(a))
\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
The line integral of a conservative vector field can be evaluated by simply knowing the value of $f$ at the endpoints of $C$.
\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
\int_C{\nabla f\cdot dr} &= \int_a^b{\nabla f(\textbf{r}(t))\cdot \textbf{r}'(t)} \\
	&= \int_a^b{(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt} +\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\frac{dz}{dt}) dt}\\
	&=\int_a^b{\frac{d}{dt}f(\textbf{r}(t))dt}\\
	&= f(\textbf{r}(b)) - f(\textbf{r}(a))
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Independence of Path}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Theorem: ConservativeLineIntegral
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{theorem}
$\int_C{\textbf{F}\cdot d\textbf{r}}$ is independent of path in $D$ if and only if $\int_C{\textbf{F}\cdot d\textbf{r}}=0$ for every closed path $C$ in $D$
\end{theorem}
Clearly it follows that $\int_C{\textbf{F}\cdot\,d\textbf{r}}=0$ for any closed path.

% Theorem: IndependentPath -> Conservative
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{theorem}[Independent Path $\rightarrow$ Conservative]
Let $\textbf{F}$ be a continuous vector field on an open connected region $D$. If $\int_C{\textbf{F}\cdot\,d\textbf{r}}$ is independent of path in $D$, then $\textbf{F}$ is a conservative vector field on $D$; that is, there exists a function $f$ such that $\nabla f = \textbf{F}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Definition: Simple Curve
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{definition}
A \textit{simple curve} is a curve that does not intersect itself any where between its endpoints.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Conservative $\rightarrow$ Equal Partials]
If $\textbf{F}(x,y)=P(x,y)\,\textbf{i}+Q(x,y)\,\textbf{j}$ is a conservative vector field, where $P$ and $Q$ have continuous first-order partial derivatives on a domain $D$, then throughout $D$ we have
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}
\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
Converse is true if $D$ is a simply-connected region (i.e. simple closed curve with no holes).
